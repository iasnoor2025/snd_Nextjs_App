# Permission Management System Update

## Overview
Updated the permission management system to provide a better organized, grouped interface for managing role permissions. The new system includes:

1. **Profile Access Fix** - Fixed the "Access Denied" issue for profile pages
2. **Equipment Document Permissions** - Added missing permissions for equipment documents
3. **Grouped Permission Interface** - Created a new organized permission management component
4. **Dedicated Permissions Page** - Created a standalone permissions management page

## üîß Profile Access Fix

### Problem
Users were getting "Access Denied" when trying to view their profile because the system was checking for `'Profile'` permissions instead of `'own-profile'` permissions.

### Solution
- **Updated Profile Page**: Changed `getAllowedActions('Profile')` to `getAllowedActions('own-profile')` in `src/app/profile/page.tsx`
- **Added Permission Mapping**: Added `own-profile` permissions to the RBAC system
- **Updated Route Permissions**: Added `/profile` route to the route permissions
- **Added to All Roles**: Added `read.own-profile` and `update.own-profile` permissions to all user roles

### Files Modified
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx`
- `src/lib/rbac/server-rbac.ts`
- `src/lib/rbac/api-middleware.ts`
- `src/lib/rbac/rbac-context.tsx`
- `scripts/setup-permissions.js`

## üîß Equipment Document Permissions

### Problem
Equipment documents existed in the system but had no specific permissions defined for them.

### Solution
- **Added Equipment Document Permissions**: Created `create.equipment-document`, `read.equipment-document`, `update.equipment-document`, `delete.equipment-document`, `manage.equipment-document`
- **Assigned to Roles**: Added appropriate permissions to different roles:
  - **ADMIN/MANAGER**: Full manage access
  - **SUPERVISOR/OPERATOR/EMPLOYEE/USER**: Read access
- **Updated RBAC System**: Added equipment document permissions to permission mappings and API middleware

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/rbac/server-rbac.ts`
- `src/lib/rbac/api-middleware.ts`
- `scripts/setup-permissions.js`
- `scripts/add-equipment-document-permissions.js` (new)
