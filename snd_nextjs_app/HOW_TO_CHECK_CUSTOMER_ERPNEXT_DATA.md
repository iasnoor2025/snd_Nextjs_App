# How to Check Customer Data in ERPNext

## Step 1: Check Local Database

The customer "AKFA UNITED COMPANY LTD" exists in your local database with:
- **ID:** 21
- **Name:** AKFA UNITED COMPANY LTD
- **Email:** INFO@AKTAUNITEA.COM
- **ERPNext ID:** AKFA UNITED COMPANY LTD (this is the key!)

## Step 2: Check ERPNext Data

I've created an API endpoint to check if this customer has data in ERPNext:

### Method 1: Via API Endpoint

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/customers/check-erpnext?name=AKFA UNITED COMPANY LTD
```

This will show:
- If customer exists in local database
- If customer has erpnextId
- Financial data from ERPNext (invoices, outstanding, etc.)

### Method 2: Direct Browser Check

Just go to the customer detail page and open browser console (F12). You'll see logs showing:
```
ðŸ“Š Fetching stats for customer ID: 21
ðŸ“Š Customer found: AKFA UNITED COMPANY LTD
ðŸ“Š Fetching customer financial data from ERPNext: AKFA UNITED COMPANY LTD
ðŸ“Š Customer financial data from ERPNext: { ... }
```

## Step 3: Expected Results

If the customer has data in ERPNext, you'll see:
- **Total Invoices:** Actual count from ERPNext
- **Outstanding:** Real outstanding amount
- **Current Due:** Actual due amount
- **Total Value:** Lifetime value from ERPNext
- **Credit Limit:** Real credit limit from ERPNext

If there's no data in ERPNext, you'll see zeros (which is correct if there truly is no data).

## What I've Implemented

### 1. ERPNext Client Method
Added `getCustomerFinancialData()` to fetch:
- Customer record from ERPNext
- All Sales Invoices for the customer
- Calculate totals and outstanding amounts

### 2. Stats API Enhancement
Updated `/api/customers/[id]/stats` to:
- Fetch ERPNext financial data if customer has erpnextId
- Merge ERPNext data with local rental data
- Return combined statistics

### 3. Check API Endpoint
Created `/api/customers/check-erpnext` to:
- Check if customer exists in local DB
- Check if customer has erpnextId
- Fetch and return ERPNext financial data

## How to Verify

1. Go to customer detail page for "AKFA UNITED COMPANY LTD"
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for logs starting with "ðŸ“Š"
4. Check if financial data is shown

## Current Status

**Customer Found:**
- âœ… Exists in local database (ID: 21)
- âœ… Has erpnextId: "AKFA UNITED COMPANY LTD"
- âœ… Will fetch data from ERPNext automatically

**Next Steps:**
1. Refresh the customer detail page
2. Check browser console for ERPNext fetch logs
3. Verify that data is displayed (not zeros)

## If Still Showing Zeros

If you're still seeing zeros, it means:

1. **ERPNext doesn't have this customer** - OR
2. **Customer exists in ERPNext but has no invoices** - OR  
3. **ERPNext connection is not working**

To diagnose:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify ERPNext environment variables are set
3. Try accessing ERPNext directly to confirm customer exists there

## Quick Test

Run this in your browser console on the customer detail page:
```javascript
fetch('/api/customers/21/stats')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => console.log('Stats:', data.stats, 'ERPNext:', data.erpnextFinancialData));
```

This will show you exactly what data is being fetched.
