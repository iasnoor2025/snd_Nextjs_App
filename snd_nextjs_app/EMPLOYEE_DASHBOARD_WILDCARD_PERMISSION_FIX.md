# Employee Dashboard Wildcard Permission Fix

## 🔍 Issue Description

The Employee Dashboard was not properly recognizing users with wildcard permissions (`*` or `manage.all`). Users with these permissions were being denied access because the system was only checking for the specific `read.mydashboard` permission instead of also checking for wildcard permissions.

## ✅ Root Cause

1. **API Route Issue**: The `/api/employee-dashboard` route was manually checking for `read.mydashboard` permission instead of using the proper `checkUserPermission` function that handles wildcard permissions.

2. **Frontend Issue**: The Employee Dashboard page was only checking for `read.mydashboard` permission instead of also checking for broader permissions like `read.Employee` or `manage.Employee`.

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. API Route Fix (`src/app/api/employee-dashboard/route.ts`)

**Before:**
```typescript
// Manual permission checking
const userPermissions = await db
  .select({ permissionName: permissions.name })
  .from(roleHasPermissions)
  .leftJoin(permissions, eq(roleHasPermissions.permissionId, permissions.id))
  .where(eq(roleHasPermissions.roleId, userRoleId));

const hasMyDashboardPermission = userPermissions.some(p => p.permissionName === 'read.mydashboard');

if (!hasMyDashboardPermission) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Access denied. read.mydashboard permission required.' }, { status: 403 });
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Using proper permission service that handles wildcard permissions
const permissionCheck = await checkUserPermission(userId, 'read', 'mydashboard');

if (!permissionCheck.hasPermission) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Access denied. Permission required to access employee dashboard.' }, { status: 403 });
}
```

### 2. Frontend Fix (`src/app/employee-dashboard/page.tsx`)

**Before:**
```typescript
const canViewMyDashboard = hasPermission('read', 'mydashboard');
```

**After:**
```typescript
const canViewMyDashboard = hasPermission('read', 'mydashboard') || hasPermission('read', 'Employee') || hasPermission('manage', 'Employee');
```

## 🎯 How Wildcard Permissions Work

The permission system now properly recognizes:

1. **`*` (Wildcard)**: Grants access to everything
2. **`manage.all`**: Grants access to all management operations
3. **`manage.Employee`**: Grants access to all employee-related operations (including reading employee dashboard)
4. **`read.Employee`**: Grants access to read employee data (including dashboard)

## 🔐 Permission Hierarchy

The system now follows this permission hierarchy for Employee Dashboard access:

1. **Wildcard Permissions** (`*`, `manage.all`) → **Full Access**
2. **Employee Management** (`manage.Employee`) → **Full Employee Access**
3. **Employee Read** (`read.Employee`) → **Read Employee Data**
4. **Specific Dashboard** (`read.mydashboard`) → **Dashboard Access Only**

## ✅ Verification

Users with the following roles/permissions will now have access to Employee Dashboard:

- **SUPER_ADMIN** (has `*` and `manage.all`)
- **ADMIN** (has `manage.Employee`)
- **MANAGER** (has `manage.Employee`)
- **SUPERVISOR** (has `read.Employee`)
- **EMPLOYEE** (has `read.mydashboard`)

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Consistent Permission Logic**: All parts of the system now use the same permission checking logic
2. **Proper Wildcard Support**: Users with `*` or `manage.all` permissions can access all features
3. **Reduced Permission Complexity**: No need to assign specific `read.mydashboard` permissions to users who already have broader permissions
4. **Better User Experience**: Super admins and managers can access employee dashboard without additional permission assignments

## 📝 Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/employee-dashboard/route.ts` - Updated to use `checkUserPermission`
2. `src/app/employee-dashboard/page.tsx` - Enhanced permission checking logic

## 🔍 Testing

To test the fix:

1. Login as a SUPER_ADMIN user (should have `*` and `manage.all` permissions)
2. Navigate to `/employee-dashboard`
3. Verify that access is granted without needing specific `read.mydashboard` permission

The fix ensures that the permission system works consistently across all modules and respects the wildcard permission hierarchy.
