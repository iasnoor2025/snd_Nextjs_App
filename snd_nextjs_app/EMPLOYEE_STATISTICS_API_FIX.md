# Employee Statistics API Fix

## Problem
The `/api/employees/statistics` endpoint was returning a 500 Internal Server Error.

## Root Cause
The issue was with the shared Prisma client from `@/lib/db`. The singleton pattern was causing connection issues in the API routes.

## Solution
Changed the API route to use an individual Prisma client instance instead of the shared one.

### Before (Broken)
```typescript
import { prisma } from '@/lib/db';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  // This was causing 500 errors
  const totalEmployees = await prisma.employee.count();
}
```

### After (Fixed)
```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const prisma = new PrismaClient();
  
  try {
    // This works correctly
    const totalEmployees = await prisma.employee.count();
  } finally {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  }
}
```

## Key Changes

1. **Import Change**: Changed from `import { prisma } from '@/lib/db'` to `import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'`

2. **Client Instantiation**: Created individual Prisma client instance: `const prisma = new PrismaClient()`

3. **Proper Cleanup**: Added `await prisma.$disconnect()` in the finally block

4. **Environment Variables**: Added missing `DIRECT_URL` environment variable to both `.env` and `.env.local` files

## Environment Variables Fixed
Added the missing `DIRECT_URL` environment variable:
```
DIRECT_URL=postgres://postgres:fAfab9Ckow7o3yp2EhryEYKzHbyeMifPBHxi8Xb4f9sdnBgMI47Ytdaq2NWDCxy5@192.168.8.4:5432/snd_nextjs_db
```

## Results
- ✅ API now returns successful responses
- ✅ All employee statistics are calculated correctly
- ✅ Database queries work as expected
- ✅ No more 500 errors

## API Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "totalEmployees": 285,
    "currentlyAssigned": 3,
    "projectAssignments": 1,
    "rentalAssignments": 0
  },
  "message": "Employee statistics retrieved successfully"
}
```

## Notes
- The shared Prisma client pattern works for other parts of the application but causes issues in API routes
- Individual Prisma client instances are more reliable for API routes
- Always ensure proper cleanup with `$disconnect()` in API routes
