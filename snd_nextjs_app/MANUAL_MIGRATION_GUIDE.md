# Manual Migration Guide: Supabase to MinIO

## 🎯 **Current Situation**

- ✅ **Files are visible** in your application (database URLs reverted to Supabase)
- ✅ **New uploads work** with Supabase
- ❌ **Automated migration failed** due to Supabase storage policy restrictions
- ✅ **MinIO is fully configured** and ready

## 🚀 **Recommended Approach: Gradual Migration**

### Phase 1: **Hybrid System** (Current)
- **Existing files**: Stay in Supabase (visible and working)
- **New uploads**: Continue using Supabase
- **MinIO**: Ready for when you want to switch

### Phase 2: **Manual Migration** (When Ready)
- Upload important files manually through your application
- Files will be stored in MinIO with correct URLs
- Update database records to point to MinIO URLs

### Phase 3: **Full MinIO Switch** (Optional)
- Change API routes to use MinIO
- Update database URLs to MinIO
- Decommission Supabase storage

## 📋 **Manual Migration Steps**

### Option 1: **Through Application Interface**
1. **Go to your application**
2. **Navigate to employee/equipment management**
3. **Re-upload important documents**
4. **Files will be stored in MinIO automatically**

### Option 2: **Bulk Upload Script**
I can create a script that:
1. **Lists all files** from your database
2. **Provides download links** for manual download
3. **Uploads them to MinIO** when you provide the files

### Option 3: **Direct File Transfer**
1. **Export files** from Supabase dashboard
2. **Upload to MinIO** using MinIO console
3. **Update database URLs** to point to MinIO

## 🔧 **Quick Commands Available**

```bash
# Test MinIO (working)
npm run test:minio

# Revert to Supabase (completed)
npm run revert:database-to-supabase

# Switch to MinIO for new uploads (when ready)
npm run migrate:database-urls-to-minio
```

## 💡 **Why This Approach Works**

1. **No Downtime**: Your application continues working
2. **Gradual Migration**: Migrate files as needed
3. **Risk-Free**: Can revert at any time
4. **Flexible**: Choose which files to migrate

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

**Choose your preferred approach:**

1. **Keep Supabase** - Continue using current system
2. **Manual Migration** - I'll create tools to help migrate specific files
3. **Hybrid System** - Use both Supabase and MinIO simultaneously

**What would you like to do?**

- Keep using Supabase for now?
- Migrate specific important files manually?
- Set up a hybrid system?
- Try a different approach?

## 📊 **Current System Status**

- ✅ **MinIO**: Configured and ready
- ✅ **Database**: 365 employee records with Supabase URLs
- ✅ **API Routes**: Using Supabase
- ✅ **Frontend**: Working with Supabase

**Your system is fully functional!** 🎉
