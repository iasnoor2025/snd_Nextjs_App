# Active Context: Flutter App Development

## Current Status
**Phase:** Project Setup & Planning (Phase 1)
**Progress:** Initial Flutter project created, Memory Bank established
**Next Focus:** Complete Flutter project setup and begin API integration

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank documentation
- Analyzed existing Next.js system architecture
- Identified Flutter project structure in `snd_rental_mobile_app/`
- Established project requirements and technical stack

## Current Work Focus
1. **Flutter Project Setup** - Complete project configuration and dependencies
2. **API Integration** - Set up HTTP client and authentication service
3. **Data Models** - Create Flutter models matching Next.js backend
4. **Authentication Flow** - Implement Google Sign-In integration
5. **Core Navigation** - Set up app routing and navigation structure

## Active Decisions
- **State Management:** Using Provider/Riverpod for state management
- **HTTP Client:** Using Dio for API communication with interceptors
- **Authentication:** Google Sign-In with Firebase integration
- **Local Storage:** SQLite for offline capabilities
- **UI Framework:** Material Design 3 with custom theming

## Next Steps
1. Complete Flutter project dependencies and configuration
2. Set up API service with authentication interceptors
3. Create core data models (Employee, Project, Equipment, etc.)
4. Implement Google Sign-In authentication flow
5. Build basic navigation structure and main screens

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure API compatibility with existing Next.js backend
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Set up secure token storage
- Plan offline data synchronization strategy
- Design responsive layouts for different screen sizes
