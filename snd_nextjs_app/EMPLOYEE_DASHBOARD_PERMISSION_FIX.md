# Employee Dashboard Permission Fix

## Overview
The Employee Dashboard has been updated to properly implement permission-based access control, ensuring users can only view their own employee data if they have the `read.mydashboard` permission.

## Current Status
✅ **Permission System**: `read.mydashboard` permission is properly set up and assigned to SUPER_ADMIN and EMPLOYEE roles
✅ **API Security**: Server-side permission validation implemented
✅ **Frontend Security**: Client-side permission checks implemented
✅ **Translation Support**: Multi-language support for all messages
⚠️ **Data Loading**: Currently investigating why employee data shows as "N/A"

## Changes Made

### 1. API Route Updates (`src/app/api/employee-dashboard/route.ts`)
- **Added permission check**: The API now verifies that users have the `read.mydashboard` permission before allowing access
- **Removed role-based access**: Replaced hardcoded role checks with dynamic permission-based access
- **Enhanced security**: Users without proper permissions receive a 403 Forbidden response
- **Added debugging**: Comprehensive logging to troubleshoot data loading issues
- **Fixed field mapping**: Corrected database field name mismatches (e.g., `currentLocation` vs `location`)

### 2. Frontend Component Updates (`src/app/employee-dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **Permission validation**: Added client-side permission check using `hasPermission('read', 'mydashboard')`
- **Access denied UI**: Shows a user-friendly access denied message for users without permissions
- **Proper error handling**: Enhanced error handling for different HTTP status codes
- **Navigation control**: Redirects unauthorized users to appropriate pages

### 3. Translation Updates
- **English locale** (`src/locales/en/dashboard.json`): Added missing translation keys
- **Arabic locale** (`src/locales/ar/dashboard.json`): Added corresponding Arabic translations

## New Translation Keys Added
```json
{
  "accessDenied": "Access Denied",
  "insufficientPermissions": "You don't have sufficient permissions to view your employee dashboard.",
  "backToHome": "Back to Home",
  "employeeNotFound": "Employee record not found",
  "errorLoadingDashboard": "Error loading dashboard data"
}
```

## Permission System

### Required Permission
- **Permission Name**: `read.mydashboard`
- **Description**: Allows users to view their own employee dashboard data
- **Scope**: User can only see their own employee information, timesheets, leaves, projects, etc.

### Permission Assignment
The `read.mydashboard` permission is automatically assigned to:
- `SUPER_ADMIN` role (always has access)
- `EMPLOYEE` role (can view their own dashboard)

### Setup API
Use the `/api/setup-mydashboard-permissions` endpoint to:
- Create the permission if it doesn't exist
- Assign it to appropriate roles
- Verify the setup

## Current Issue: Data Not Loading

### Problem Description
The Employee Dashboard is showing "N/A" for all employee data fields, indicating that the data is not being fetched from the database properly.

### Debugging Added
The API now includes comprehensive logging to help identify the issue:
- Session user information
- User permissions
- Database query results
- Employee record details

### Possible Causes
1. **No Employee Record**: The user might not have an employee record in the database
2. **User ID Mismatch**: The session user ID might not match the employee.userId field
3. **Permission Issue**: The permission check might be failing silently
4. **Database Connection**: There might be a database connection issue

## How It Works

### 1. Permission Check Flow
```
User visits /employee-dashboard
    ↓
Check if user has 'read.mydashboard' permission
    ↓
If YES: Fetch and display user's own data
    ↓
If NO: Show access denied message
```

### 2. Data Isolation
- Users can only see their own employee record
- Timesheets, leaves, projects, and documents are filtered by the user's employee ID
- No cross-user data access is possible

### 3. Security Features
- **API-level protection**: Server-side permission validation
- **Client-side validation**: Frontend permission checks
- **Proper error handling**: Clear feedback for unauthorized access
- **Audit trail**: Permission checks are logged

## Testing

### 1. Test Permission Setup
```bash
# Visit the test page
http://localhost:3000/test-mydashboard-permissions

# Or use the API directly
POST /api/setup-mydashboard-permissions
```

### 2. Test Access Control
1. **With Permission**: User should see their own dashboard data
2. **Without Permission**: User should see access denied message
3. **API Protection**: Direct API calls should return 403 for unauthorized users

### 3. Test Data Loading
1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for debugging information in the server console
2. **Verify Employee Record**: Ensure the user has an employee record in the database
3. **Check User ID Match**: Verify session.user.id matches employee.userId

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Not Found**
   - Run the setup API: `POST /api/setup-mydashboard-permissions`
   - Check database for permission existence

2. **Access Denied for Valid Users**
   - Verify user has the correct role
   - Check role-permission assignments
   - Review user session data

3. **Data Not Loading (Current Issue)**
   - Check server console for debugging logs
   - Verify user has an employee record in the database
   - Check if session.user.id matches employee.userId
   - Ensure database connection is working

4. **Translation Keys Missing**
   - Ensure all locale files are updated
   - Check for typos in translation keys
   - Verify i18n configuration

### Debug Steps

1. **Check User Permissions**
   ```bash
   GET /api/user-permissions
   ```

2. **Verify Permission Setup**
   ```bash
   POST /api/setup-mydashboard-permissions
   ```

3. **Check Server Console**
   - Look for permission-related logs
   - Check employee query results
   - Verify database connections

4. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for API response errors
   - Check for JavaScript errors
   - Verify permission checks

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Check Server Logs**: Visit the employee dashboard and check server console for debugging information
2. **Verify Employee Record**: Check if the current user has an employee record in the database
3. **Test Permission System**: Verify that the permission check is working correctly

### Data Investigation
1. **Database Query**: Check if the employee query is returning results
2. **User ID Mapping**: Verify the relationship between users and employees tables
3. **Field Mapping**: Ensure all database fields are correctly mapped

### Potential Solutions
1. **Create Employee Record**: If the user doesn't have an employee record, create one
2. **Fix User ID Mapping**: Ensure the session user ID correctly maps to employee.userId
3. **Database Schema**: Verify the database schema matches the expected field names

## Benefits

### 1. **Security**
- Prevents unauthorized access to employee data
- Implements proper data isolation
- Follows principle of least privilege

### 2. **User Experience**
- Clear feedback when access is denied
- Proper error messages in multiple languages
- Smooth navigation for authorized users

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Centralized permission management
- Easy to modify access rules
- Consistent with overall RBAC system

## Conclusion

The Employee Dashboard now properly implements permission-based access control, ensuring that users can only view their own data if they have the appropriate permissions. The current issue with data not loading is being investigated with comprehensive debugging added to the API.

The implementation follows best practices for:
- **Security**: Proper permission validation at multiple levels
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback and appropriate navigation
- **Maintainability**: Centralized permission management
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support for all messages
- **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

**Next Action**: Check the server console logs when accessing the employee dashboard to identify why the employee data is not being loaded.
