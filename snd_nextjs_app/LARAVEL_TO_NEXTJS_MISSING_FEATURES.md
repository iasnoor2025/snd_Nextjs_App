## Conclusion

The Laravel application represents a comprehensive enterprise management system with extensive functionality across 16 modules. The Next.js application currently has basic implementations for some modules but lacks the depth and breadth of features available in the Laravel version.

**Estimated Development Effort:**
- **High Priority Features**: 3-4 months
- **Medium Priority Features**: 2-3 months  
- **Low Priority Features**: 2-3 months
- **Total Estimated Time**: 7-10 months for full feature parity

**Recommendation:**
Focus on implementing high-priority core business functions first, then gradually add operational and advanced features based on business needs and user feedback.
