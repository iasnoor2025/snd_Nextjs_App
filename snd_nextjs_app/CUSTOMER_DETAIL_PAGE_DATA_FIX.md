# Customer Detail Page Data Display Fix

## Problem
The customer detail page was showing all zeros for financial metrics (Total Rentals, Total Invoices, Outstanding, Credit Limit, etc.) because it wasn't properly fetching and aggregating data from the database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created New Stats API Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/customers/[id]/stats/route.ts`

This endpoint provides comprehensive customer statistics:

```typescript
GET /api/customers/[id]/stats
```

**Returns:**
- Total rentals count and total value
- Total invoices count and invoiced amount
- Outstanding amount (sum of unpaid active rentals)
- Total paid amount
- Credit limit information
- Customer rental history

**Features:**
- Aggregates rental data from the database
- Calculates outstanding amounts from unpaid rentals
- Fetches invoice counts from rental_invoices table
- Calculates credit limit usage
- Returns full rental history

### 2. Updated Customer Detail Page
**File:** `src/app/[locale]/modules/customer-management/[id]/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Now fetches data from the new `/stats` endpoint
- Displays real data instead of zeros
- Properly aggregates rental invoices
- Shows actual outstanding amounts
- Displays real credit limit usage

### 3. Data Flow

```
Customer Detail Page Loads
    ↓
Fetches /api/customers/[id]/stats
    ↓
Stats API:
  - Queries rentals table for this customer
  - Aggregates total rentals and values
  - Calculates outstanding from unpaid rentals
  - Fetches invoice count
  - Returns all rental records
    ↓
Page displays:
  - Total Rentals: Real count from DB
  - Total Invoices: Real count from DB
  - Outstanding: Sum of unpaid active rentals
  - Credit Limit: From customer record
  - Total Value: Sum of all rental values
  - Current Due: Outstanding amount
```

## Financial Metrics Now Showing

### Primary Stats Cards
1. **Total Rentals** - Actual count from database
2. **Total Invoices** - Actual count from database
3. **Outstanding** - Sum of unpaid active rentals
4. **Status** - Customer status

### Additional Stats Cards
1. **Credit Limit** - From customer record
2. **Current Due** - Outstanding amount
3. **Total Value** - Lifetime value
4. **Currency** - Default currency (SAR)

### Lists
- **Rentals Tab** - Shows all rentals for this customer
- **Invoices Tab** - Shows all invoices for this customer
- **Documents Tab** - Shows customer documents

## Technical Details

### API Query Structure
```typescript
// Get rental statistics
const rentalStats = await db
  .select({
    totalRentals: count(),
    totalRentalValue: sum(rentals.totalAmount),
    totalFinalAmount: sum(rentals.finalAmount),
  })
  .from(rentals)
  .where(eq(rentals.customerId, customerId));

// Get all rentals for this customer
const customerRentals = await db
  .select()
  .from(rentals)
  .where(eq(rentals.customerId, customerId));

// Calculate outstanding (unpaid active rentals)
const outstandingRentals = customerRentals.filter(
  rental => rental.paymentStatus !== 'paid' && rental.status === 'active'
);
const outstandingAmount = outstandingRentals.reduce(
  (total, rental) => total + parseFloat(rental.finalAmount || '0'),
  0
);
```

## Testing

### Verify Data Display
1. Navigate to a customer detail page
2. Check that statistics show real data instead of zeros
3. Verify rental count matches actual rentals
4. Verify outstanding amount is calculated correctly
5. Check that invoices list shows rental invoices

### Expected Results
- **Total Rentals:** Shows actual count (not 0)
- **Total Invoices:** Shows actual count (not 0)
- **Outstanding:** Shows sum of unpaid rentals (not SAR 0.00)
- **Credit Limit:** Shows customer's credit limit or "SAR 0.00"
- **Current Due:** Shows outstanding amount (not SAR 0.00)
- **Total Value:** Shows sum of all rental values (not SAR 0.00)

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Data** - Shows actual customer activity from database
2. **Accurate Metrics** - Calculated from actual rental records
3. **Better UX** - Users see meaningful data instead of zeros
4. **Proper Aggregation** - Correctly sums and counts records
5. **Performance** - Single endpoint fetches all needed data

## Integration with ERPNext Sync

The customer detail page now works with the bidirectional ERPNext sync:

- When a customer is synced from ERPNext, their data appears here
- When rentals are created/updated, stats update automatically
- Financial metrics reflect real business operations
- Outstanding amounts help with credit limit management

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/api/customers/[id]/stats/route.ts` - New stats endpoint
2. `src/app/[locale]/modules/customer-management/[id]/page.tsx` - Updated data fetching

## Notes

- The stats are calculated on-demand (not cached)
- Outstanding amount includes only unpaid active rentals
- Invoice count includes all invoices from rental_invoices table
- All financial amounts are in SAR (Saudi Riyal)
- Status badges reflect rental payment status
